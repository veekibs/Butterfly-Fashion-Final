# ü¶ã Butterfly Fashion: A Full-Stack E-commerce Rewrite

This repository contains the full-stack, monolithic Django application for "Butterfly Fashion," a mission-driven e-commerce platform. This project is the final, polished result of a complete rewrite of my original A-level Computer Science coursework.

## The Story: A Project on the Brink of Collapse

This project didn't start as a clean, single repository. It started as a chaotic, multi-repo attempt to refactor a legacy frontend I wrote when I was 17. After weeks of battling a crumbling foundation and a series of impossible-to-debug errors, I made the critical and professional decision to pivot to a complete rewrite.

This repository is the story of that pivot. It's an honest, unfiltered look at the process of architecting a professional-grade, full-stack application from scratch.
