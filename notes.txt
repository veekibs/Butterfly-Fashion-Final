future feature ideas wohooooo (product manager in the making??? hahaha)

- product detail pages (click a product -> land on its own page with size/colour options, reviews, etc...) because hovering is CUTE but not enough smh
- wishlist feature ONLY FOR LOGGED IN USERS soz (save items to come back later - cos they WILL come back xoxo)
- better filtering system (instead of that floating spaceship thing from hamburger mobile it comes out from the side like a proper website ennit)
